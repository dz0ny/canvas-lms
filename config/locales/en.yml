        In order to make it easier for users, rather than forcing them to download things like Word docs, PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, and open office documents (In addition to requiring that those programs be installed on their on their computer), in many areas throughout Canvas, it will allow you an inline preview of the document.
        
        If Scribd has been enabled for this account, it will try to use it to show the preview. But because Scribd uses flash paper to display the documents, and many users (namely those using an iPad/iPhone) do not have Flash Player installed, that preview will not work.  By leaving Google Docs Previews enabled, when a browser does not have Flash enabled, or if Scribd is not enabled, it will use preview powered by Google Docs.

              Assignment groups are used to organize assignments.  You provide a name for each
                      group.  If you choose to weight the final grade based on groups (*where?*) then
                      you can also set a percentage score for each group.  Click "Add Assignment Group"
                      to create a group.
          overview: |-
            This page is for setting up your course at a high level.  You can add assignments,
                    group them and then weight those groups.  The idea is to get yourself organized
                    first, dive into the specifics second.  Even still, there's a lot you can do
                    from here.
          quizzes: |-
            Quizzes are special types of assignments.  You can create or import quizzes by
                    clicking the "Quizzes" link on the left sidebar.
          step1: |-
            Assignments are always organized into groups, so to add an assignment you first
                    need to know what group you want to add it to.  Select the group and click 
                    "Add Assignment to" or Click the %{add_icon} icon to start
                    a new assignment for a group.
          step2: |-
            Great!  Now fill in your details.  You can enter a title for your assignment,
                    a due date and the number of points possible.  If you want to do more than that
                    you can, but only after the assignment has been created.
          step3: |-
            Done!  The assignment is now added to the group!  If you hover your mouse over the

          That one's easy.  Just drag the event to a new date and let go.  Or you can
                  click the event and then click "Edit" to get a little more specific.

        edit: |-
          Great!  Now just enter a name for the event (*where?*).  You can specify a start and
                  end time for the event if you like.  Or just a start time.  Or no time at all. Click "Submit" to finish.
        edit_assignment: |-
          Now just enter a name for the assignment (*where?*) and the assignment

          EtherPad is a site that lets you quickly set
                up shared documents.  It's fast enough that you can see what others are typing as they're
                typing it -- although "pads" aren't protected by a password so anyone that knows about them
                can edit them.  EtherPad might be better suited than Google Docs for things like taking
                notes because it's so fast.
        google_docs: |-
          Google Docs are a great place to collaborate
                on a group project.  It's like Microsoft Word, but lets you work together with others
                on the same file without having to email it around.  You'll need a Google account
                in order to participate in any Google Docs collaborations.

        Free online web tools like [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) and [EtherPad](http://www.etherpad.org)
        are an excellent place for students to work on group projects or papers, take shared notes, etc.
        Teacher *or* students can set up group collaborations.

        to work collaboratively on tasks like group papers or note-taking.  This page is
        an easy place to keep track of those collaborations, and also to set them
        up without having to swap emails.

          Course modules let you organize your assignments, pages, files, etc. into smaller sections or units. Modules could be centered around a theme, focused on a specific topic, or even just grouped chronologically.
          
          You can also sequence modules by defining criteria and prerequisites for each module. Students won't be able to access modules until they have unlocked all their prerequisites. That way you can prevent students from accessing certain content or files until they have, say, gotten at least 75% on a review quiz.
          
          To start organizing your course into modules, click the "%{button}" button to the right.

        hashtags: |-
          Hashtags are special phrases that let people consistently mention the same idea (like a course) on web sites like Twitter.  For example, the message "I like #instructure" is using the hashtag "instructure".
          
          Hashtags should consist of letters, numbers, dashes and underscores (no spaces).  The hashtag should be unique, easily recognizable, and short.  Short hashtags are better since sites like Twitter limit the number of letters per message.

        assignments: Add your assignments.  You can just make a long list, or break them up into groups -- and even specify weights for each assignment group.
        available: Now that your course is set up and available, you probably won't need this checklist anymore.  But we'll keep it around in case you realize later you want to try something new, or you just want a little extra help as you make changes to your course content.
        calendar: Here's a great chance to get to know the calendar -- and add any non-assignment events you might have to the course.  Don't worry, we'll help you through it.

            Great, so you've got a course...  Now what?  Well, before you go publishing it to the world, you may want to check and make sure you've got the basics laid out.  Work through the list on the left to ensure that your course is ready to use.
            
            *This course is visible only to teachers until it is published*
          saved: Done and done!  Your course, %{course} is now officially created. It's only visible to you until is is published -- but before you jump the gun, you'll want to run through the list to the left to get a feel for how Canvas works and to make sure you really are ready to teach.
        created:

            This class has been created, but not claimed.  It'll get deleted if it's not claimed within a week.  In the mean time, tick through the list to the left to make sure you're ready to go.
            
            If you need to leave and come back before then, just save *this link* to get back here later.
            
            Please **log in** or ***register*** to claim this course.

        files: The Files tab is the place to share lecture slides, example documents, study helps -- anything your students will want to download.  Uploading and organizing your files is easy with Canvas.  We'll show you how.
        home: When people visit the course, this is the page they'll see.  You can set it to show an activity stream, the list of course modules, a syllabus, or a custom page you write yourself.  The default is the course activity stream.  To customize this, just click %{change_layout}.
        import: If you've been using another course management system, you probably have stuff in there that you're going to want moved over to Canvas.  We can walk you through the process of easily migrating your content into Canvas.
        navigation: By default all links are enabled for a course.  Students won't see links to sections that don't have content.  For example, if you haven't created any quizzes, they won't see the quizzes link.  You can sort and explicitly disable these links if there are areas of the course you don't want your students accessing.
        publish: 
          form: |-
            All finished?  Time to publish your course!  Click the button below to make it official!
            
            Publishing will send out email invitations to all the course users so they can sign up and start participating.
          not_registered: This course is claimed and ready, but you'll need to finish the registration process before you can publish the course.  You should have received an email from Canvas with a link to finish the process.  Be sure to check your spam box.
        students: You'll definitely want some of these.  What's the fun of teaching a course if nobody's even listening?
        tas: You may want to assign some TA's to help you with the course.  TA's can grade student submissions, help moderate the discussions and even update due dates and assignment details for you.

          ePortfolios are a place where you can display and discuss the significant
          submissions and experiences that are happening during your learning
          process. You can use an ePortfolio to:
          
          * Display the papers you're proud of for more than just your instructor to see
          * Talk about all the thought and work that went into your class submissions
          * Gather an overview of your educational experience as a whole
          * Share your work with friends, future employers, etc.
          
          ePortfolios can be public for everyone to see, or private so only those you
          allow can see, and you can change that setting at any time.

            default group above to get you started.  You can add assignments to it by clicking the plus icon,
            or use the links to the right to create your own groups.
      grade_groups_notice: Nicely done. Next you'll want to define the assignments for your course. Most classes base grades either on straight points, or points according to types (50% of your grade is from tests, 20% is from papers, etc.). In Canvas you add assignments, quizzes, or whatever into groups and optionally weight those groups. Build your Canvas course to match the grading scheme of your actual course, and we'll take care of computing your final grade for you.

      group_explanation: |
        Groups are a good place to collaborate on projects or to figure out schedules for study sessions
        and the like.  Every group gets a calendar, a wiki, discussions, and a little bit of space to store
        files.  Groups can collaborate on documents, or even schedule web conferences.  
        It's really like a mini-course where you can work with a smaller number of students on a
        more focused project.

      groups_disabled: Student-organized groups have been disabled for this course, so you'll have to be content with the groups the teacher makes for you.

      student_group_warning: |
        If your teacher has talked about putting you into
        groups as part of an assignment, this is not the way to make that happen.
        Groups you organize yourself can't be used for grading... you can still form
        your own groups, but you won't be able to turn in an electric copy of any
        assignments unless your teacher builds the groups for you.

      equation_functions: |
        In addition to variables, there are also a collection of helper functions
        you can use to generate useful values.  For example:
        
        %{example}
        
        To see an exaplanation of a given helper function, select it from the list
        below:

      equation_intro: |
        Calculated questions are based on a set of one or more formulas computed 
        in order.  You can define intermediate variables in these formulas, but the
        numerical result of the last formula is what is used to generate the
        correct answer.  For example:
        
        %{example}
        
        For this set of formulas, the final answer is 71.  However,
        there are no predefined variables, so all students would have the
        same question with the same answer. See the "variables" tab for more
        information on variables.

      equation_variables: |
        You can also define variables in you question text using brackets 
        ("What is [a] + [b]?").  For every variable, you'll see an "Example Value"
        based on the variable settings.  This is so you can check your math and
        make sure your formulas work.
        
        For example, if your question was "What is [a] + 5?" then you'd
        be asked to define the variable "a".  If the example value for "a" 
        were 5.2, you could write:
        
        %{example}
        
        With this formula you can generate any number of solution sets, with a 
        different value of "a" in each set.  One student might see the question,
        "What is 5.2 + 5?" and another might see "What is 9 + 5?".
